                I have always been intrested in two things: Art and Science. 
                Both seems to head in opposite directions but always end up colliding.
                Sweet Dawn is one of those collision.   
              </div>
              <div>      

                The goal of Sweet Dawn is to create a corpus of interactive art pieces 
                allowing an active audiance to play visually with artificial intelligences.

            This is the first prototype of interactive piece.
            It connects the YOLO v3 algorithm to a generated arpegio.
            The more people it sees, the fuller the Arpegiato.

          All of the expriments are coded by myself using python. But I re-used some algorithms.
